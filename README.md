Menherafflesia: Flowering Abyss English Patch

This is a repository for the an English conversion patch for the game Menherafflesia. 

Notable Changes:

Translated UI

Subtitled Cinematics

Fully Translated Story

Quality of Life Improvements

This repository is currently under development. UI is not fully translated yet.

Routes Finished:

Prologue

Matsuri

I am working on translating the second route now and it should be available shortly.

Use:

Simply drop the file "tyranoproject.tpatch" into your game folder and the game should auto-detect the patch and play as intended.

Once again, this is work in development, constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated, but offensive language or abusive behavior is not.
