<h1>Menherafflesia: Flowering Abyss English Patch</h1>

This is a repository for the English conversion patch for the game Menherafflesia. 

<h2>Notable Changes:</h2>

* Translated UI

* Subtitled Cinematics

* Fully Translated Story

* Quality of Life Improvements

This repository is currently under development. UI is not fully translated yet.

<h2>Routes Finished:</h2>

* Prologue

* Matsuri

I am working on translating the second route now and it should be available shortly.

<h2>Use:</h2>

Simply drop the file "tyranoproject.tpatch" into your game folder and the game should auto-detect the patch and play as intended.

Once again, this is work in development, constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated, but offensive language or abusive behavior is not.
